# Testing
Through extensive testing and analysis, I have dedicated significant time and effort to ensure the functionality and reliability of the website. I have conducted numerous tests and assessments, leaving no stone unturned in the pursuit of a seamless user experience. These rigorous evaluations have instilled in me a genuine confidence that the site operates at its best, meeting the standards of excellence I set out to achieve. The data and feedback collected from this testing process have been invaluable in shaping a website that not only meets user expectations but also exceeds them. With each test, I have fortified my belief that the site is finely tuned and ready to provide users with a smooth and efficient online journey.

Ensuring compatibility with various web browsers and screen sizes is a fundamental aspect of a modern website's functionality and accessibility. This guarantees that users, regardless of their preferred browser, can access and interact with the site seamlessly. In addition to browser compatibility, the website is also responsive to a wide range of screen sizes. Whether visitors are using a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or a smartphone, the site's responsive design adapts gracefully to the dimensions of the device. This adaptability ensures that content is presented in an organized and visually pleasing manner, irrespective of the screen size, thereby providing an optimal user experience.

During the extensive testing process, I did come across a few bugs and issues that provided valuable insights for improving future projects. These findings served as important lessons in enhancing the development process and ensuring a more refined end product. These included bugs like images not loading in the page, code not being valid and many more. In future projects, I will place a greater emphasis on robust testing and quality control processes to identify and address potential issues earlier in the development cycle.

* ## Validator Testing

1. HTML. [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
2. CSS. [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator#errors)

* ## Unfixed Bugs
  1. I had some bugs with my sign in page and it wasn't ideal for users as they might get confused at the page but nevertheless it's functioning.
  2. The sign in page isn't the best to use for mobile devices as the picture shrinks and you can no longer see the image.
  3. Also, I dont have 'the footer' on my sign in page and I don't know where I went wrong.
